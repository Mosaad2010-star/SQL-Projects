Description: Analyze customer churn (the rate at which customers leave a service) using transactional data. 


This project simulates a customer retention scenario and involves building a predictive model 

by calculating churn rates and analyzing the factors contributing to customer attrition.

Scenario: Imagine youâ€™re working for a subscription-based service 

(such as a SaaS platform, a streaming service, or a telecom company).

 The goal is to analyze user activity and subscription data to identify patterns that predict churn.

Skills Involved:

Complex SQL queries involving JOIN operations and aggregate functions.

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.) for advanced analytics.

Time series analysis for trends over time.

Calculating churn rate and retention rate.
